Finally, now the end of the term is approaching, and so are the finals... After I have done the assigned reading in the course, I felt that I have a lot of thoughts on reading and writing, which are the main parts of "Yu Wen" (语文）. I hated it because I couldn't get high marks as other subjects when I was in middle school. However, after I graduated from the high school for such a long time and I don't need to prepare for the Gao Kao, I realized the beauty of it... So I wrote down some [thoughts](/pdfs/du_yu_hua_you_gan.pdf).


Also [this book review](/pdfs/China_in_ten_words.pdf) is in fufillment of the assignment requirement for EASIA 202R.
