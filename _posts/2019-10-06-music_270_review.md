# Musical Density: Triads, Seventh Chords, and Texture

> Supplementary chapter from *The Complete Musician*, Chapter 3

So far, we have studied melody and two-voice counterpoint. We now move into the third and final building block of tonal music: harmony. As stated earlier, harmony is most easily viewed as filling in the musical space provided by the counterpoint of two outer voices. The usual format for discussing harmony is the chorale texture: soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Thus, the soprano and bass provide the **outer-voice counterpoint**, and the alto and tenor fill in the space between the soprano and bass, creating **chords**.

## Triads

### Triad Types

* diminished (d)
* minor (m)
* major (M)
* augmented (A)

### Triad Inversions

A triad is in **root position** if the root is the lowest-sounding pitch-that
is, the root is in the bass. If the third or the fifth of a triad appears in the
bass, the triad is in **first inversion** or **second inversion**.
It doesn't matter how the pitches above the bass are distributed;
the pitch in the bass determines whether the chord is in root position
or an inversion.

* Root position (Root in bass)
* First inversion (3rd in bass)
* Second inversion (5th in bass)

In tonal music, the character and behavior of chords depends on the
intervals formed among voices, especially between the bass and the voices
above it. As we've seen, root-position major and minor triads are consonant
(relatively stable) because of the perfect fifth between their root and fifth,
whereas diminished triads are dissonant (relatively unstable) because of the
diminished fifth between their root and fifth.

When inverted, each type of triad becomes progressively less stable. For
example, in first inversion, major and minor triads are less stable than in root
position, because they include the intervals of a perfect fourth and a minor or
major sixth. This is not true, however, for diminished triads: In root position
they are highly dissonant because of the diminished fifth, but in first inversion,
only consonant thirds and sixths sound above the bass (the tritone is less
audible, because it does not involve the bass).

In second inversion, major and minor triads are regarded as dissonant
because the perfect fourth is now formed with the bass, which drives the
harmony. (Remember that in two voices, the perfect fourth is considered
dissonant.) Even in textures of three or more voices (as in the present case),
when a perfect fourth is formed with the bass, we hear it as dissonant.
Both root-position and first-inversion triads are common in tonal music;
however, second-inversion triads, due to their greater instability, occur only in
restricted contexts. Thus while triads in root position and first inversion are
more or less interchangeable, second-inversion triads are in a class of their own.

## Figured Bass

Many composers who were active between 1600 and 1800 used a shorthand
notation to describe the intervals created by notes sounding above the bass.
This type of shorthand, **figured bass**, is a handy way of understanding chord
construction as well as melodic movement between chords. (Today's leadsheet
symbols of jazz and popular music serve a similar purpose.) Figured
bass is predicated on the fact that the bass is harmonically the most important
voice of any texture. A figured bass has two components:

1. A bass note.
2. Numbers, or "figures" -- listed under the bass -- that indicate the generic intervals formed by the bass and each of the other voices. The numbers are typically listed one below another, from largest to smallest.

### Figured Bass Chromaticism

Figured bass follows the given key signature-that is, the notes above the
bass follow the given key signature unless the figure is altered. A few common
ways to indicate chromatic alterations to notes above the bass include:

* If there is an accidental on a pitch above the bass, the same accidental is
attached to the corresponding interval in the figured bass.
* If an accidental occurs on the pitch that is a third above the bass, the
number 3 is omitted and only the accidental is written.
* A plus sign or a slash through a number raises the pitch by one half step.
* If the bass note is chromatically altered, nothing changes in the figure,
since the figure indicates only intervals above the bass.

### Figured Bass and Melodic Motion

Figured bass can also show the melodic motion of individual voices,
especially voices that move by step. A dash between numbers
shows motion in the same voice, as viewed from the bass.

## Triads and the Scale: Harmonic Analysis

Each scale degree of a major or minor scale can support a triad constructed of
pitches from that scale. We use roman numerals to represent triads: The
numeral indicates the scale degree on which a triad is built, and the case of the
roman numeral reflects a triad's quality. Uppercase roman numerals are used
for major triads, lowercase numerals for minor triads, and diminished triads
are represented by lowercase roman numerals with the addition of a degree
sign.

### Complete Harmonic Analysis

A complete harmonic analysis combines roman numerals and figured
bass. The roman numeral identifies the root (by scale degree) and quality of a
triad, and a figure identifies root position or inversion. Finally, recall
that figured bass can also identify melodic motion by individual voices
above the bass (such as 5-6 or 4-3).

## Harmony and the Keyboard

**Keyboard style** is a four-voice texture in which three notes (voices) are played
in the right hand, within the space of one octave, and one note (voice) is
played in the left hand. The notes in the right hand are labeled (from highest
to lowest) soprano, alto, and tenor. The bass is played with the left hand.
This helps to emphasize the outer voices, and is the most common hand
position we will use. Further, on occasion you will be writing in keyboard
style, although most of our writing will place the upper two voices (soprano
and alto) in the treble clef and the lower two voices (tenor and bass) in the
bass clef, a distribution called **chorale style**. Example 3.11 shows the harmonic
progression I-V-I in both keyboard style and chorale style.

### Four-Voice Styles

## Seventh Chords

Sonorities with four notes that can be stacked in thirds are called **seventh
chords**. We identify seventh chords by their two most audible features: the
type of triad formed by the root, third, and fifth of the chord; and the type of
seventh above the root of the chord. There are five important types of seventh
chords-though, like the triad types, they are not used with equal frequency.
Example 3.12 shows the following qualities of chords, built on the root C:

* major seventh chord (MM7)
* dominant seventh chord (Mm7)
* minor seventh chord (mm7)
* half-diminished seventh chord (dm7)
* diminished, or fully diminished, seventh chord (dd7)

### Inversion of Seventh Chords

<img src="/pics/music270/seven_inversion.png" alt="seven_inversion" width="70%">

When we analyze seventh chords with roman numerals, we use the following to show the chord qualities:

* MM7 and Mm7 chords use uppercase roman numerals.
* mm7 chords use lowercase roman numerals.
* dm7 chords use lowercase roman numerals, plus a slashed degree sign (<sup>&Oslash;</sup>).
* dd7 chords use lowercase roman numerals, plus a degree sign (&deg;).

## Musical Texture

So far we have explored triads and seventh chords in their most simple form:
as simultaneously sounding vertical sonorities. Vertical alignment is but one
of many ways that composers distribute the members of a chord.

**Texture** refers to many elements of music, including register and timbre
of instrumental combinations. But in particular, texture refers to music's
density (e.g., the number of voices and their spacing). Tonal music has many
types of texture, but we can group them into three basic categories, each of
which is distinguished by the way the melody is projected. The following
excerpts from the literature illustrate the three basic textures: monophonic,
polyphonic, and homophonic.

**Monophonic texture** is defined as a single-line melody with no
accompaniment. Both a cantus firmus and a tune you whistle are monophonic
textures. Schubert's last symphony begins monophonically with
horns that play the primary melody of the first movement (Example 3.16).
Note that a texture can be monophonic even though it might be played (e.g.,
in octaves) by more than one instrument.

**Polyphonic**, or **contrapuntal**, **texture** is the combination of two or more
melodies so there is no clear distinction between melody and accompaniment.

**Homophonic texture** is a cross between monophonic and polyphonic
textures, given that there is usually a clear melody accompanied by
additional voices. The accompaniments can be highly varied; this richness of
possibilities is why homophonic texture is the most widespread of the three
texture types in common-practice music. The vertical, block-chord chorale
texture we have been studying is one of the simplest types of homophonic
textures, given that the accompanying voices are rhythmically aligned with
the primary voice, which usually appears in the highest register.
In most homophonic textures, however, single harmonies are spread
out over time, with their chordal members distributed over one or more
beats, measures, or even multiple measures.

## Analytical Method

> Example 3.18C is the first 4 measures of *Mozart, Piano Sonata in C major, K. 545, Allegro*.

The harmonies in Example 3.18C unfold at a leisurely pace, given that there
are only seven chords in four measures. Depending on the composer, style
period, and type of piece, chords may change slowly or quickly. The rate of
harmonic change is called **harmonic rhythm**.

The preceding clunky analysis is improved by a more concise and informative
roman numeral analysis. (Note values that correspond to the duration
of each harmony reveal the harmonic rhythm.)

Mozart is able to write such a slow harmonic rhythm because of the
rhythmic interest created by the accompanimental figures, which-along
with the tune-contain each of the chord members. The broken-chord
accompanimental pattern in Example 3.18C, called an **Alberti bass**, is
common in the Classical style. The Alberti bass and other such
accompanimental patterns are effective because our ears collect the
individual pitches of the broken-chord figure into a single harmony.
