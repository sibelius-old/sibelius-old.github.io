I want to find a command line code or bash script to unrar all the files in subfolder. This is can be easily done by:

```bash
find Photos/ -name '*.rar' -execdir unrar e {} \;
```

However, this will output all unzipped files in current folder. Then I tried a script from [here](https://gist.github.com/binarynonsense/d6360e918d21c84107b2):

```bash
#! /bin/sh

# ref: http://bashscripts.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=908
# ref : http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/unrar-multiple-files-into-seprated-directory-base-on-their-name-927127/

echo "starting unrar in folders"

# for everything named *.rar
for filename in *.rar

    do

        foldername=$(basename "$filename" .rar)
        echo $foldername
        mkdir "$foldername"
        cd "$foldername"
        unrar x ../"$filename"
        cd ..

    done

echo "finished unrar in folders"
```

> Note that `cd` doesn't simply work in bash script if you call it like `./cdscript`. Instead, you can do `. ./cdscript`. See [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/27139/script-to-change-current-directory-cd-pwd) for details.

Then I found this approach also has limitations since in my subdirectories, all zip files have same name, and all files in zip files have same names. Something like:

```
subdirA
    - A.zip
        - a.csv
        - b.csv
        - c.csv
    - B.zip
        - a.csv
        - b.csv
        - c.csv

subdirB
- A.zip
    - a.csv
    - b.csv
    - c.csv
- B.zip
    - a.csv
    - b.csv
    - c.csv

...
```

Then I modified the script without `cd`, then it works perfectly!

```bash

#!/bin/bash

for filename in $( find . -name '*.rar' )
    do
        foldername=${filename%.*}            # remove the rar suffix
        mkdir "$foldername"
        unrar e "$filename" "$foldername"    # unrar to a specific folder
        echo "------------分割线------------" # separating line
    done

```
