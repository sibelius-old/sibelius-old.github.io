Here is a summary of Korean players in FIFAOL3. Though we all know that (from wiki):
> The tournament was criticized for many poor and questionable refereeing decisions. South Korea in particular faced scrutiny and allegations of corruption due to the favorable decisions they received in their controversial victories over Italy in the Round of 16 and over Spain in the quarter-finals.

> 韩国靠着裁判充满争议的判决下接连击败葡萄牙、意大利、西班牙等强国后挺进四强，并夺下殿军，写下队史最不光荣的一页。

Son Heung-Min now is really the top Asian goalscorer.
