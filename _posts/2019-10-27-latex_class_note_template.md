Since cross references in lecture notes are important, I created a template for theorem/lemma/proposition... blocks with beamer skin and proof/remark... blocks and equation block. You can see the result via [here](/pdfs/template.pdf) and the LaTeX code via [here](https://github.com/Sibelius-6/class-note-template).
